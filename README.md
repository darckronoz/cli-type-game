# CLI Type Game

A terminal-based typing practice game inspired by **Monkeytype**. Improve your typing skills right from your CLI!

## Features

- **Speed Typing Practice** - Test your typing speed with randomly generated words or custom text
- **Performance Metrics** - Track your:
  - Words Per Minute (WPM) - typing speed measurement
  - Accuracy - percentage of correctly typed characters
  - Session History - see how you've improved over time
- **Progress Tracking** - View statistics and improvements across multiple sessions
- **CLI-Native Experience** - No browser needed, practice directly in your terminal

## How It Works

1. Start a typing session
2. Type the displayed words/text as accurately and quickly as possible

4. Build your statistics database to track long-term progress
